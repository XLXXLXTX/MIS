Waterfall methodology: Tasks and phases are completed in a linear, sequential manner, 
and each stage of the project must be completed before the next one begins.
Stages: Requirements -> Analysis -> Design -> Construction -> Testing -> Deployment & maintenance
Useful when:
    -Goal is clearly defined (won't be changed)
    -Stakeholders know exactly what they want (won't be changed)
    -Project is consistent and predictable
    -Intensive tracking or documentation is needed
    -Many people join midway through the project, so they need to join quickly

Agile methodology: Teams are allowed to revise their project as many times as needed 
during the process instead of waiting until the end of the process to review and resolve issues.
Useful when:
    -Project is likely to change
    -Uncertain about how the final solution will look
    -Work quickly is needed, and see the speed in progress than in results
    -Clients/Stakeholders would like to be involved at every stage of the process

Scrum methodology: It is a form of agile methodology, like a framework, where work 
is split into cycles known as sprints of 1-2 weeks. At the end of these periods, 
a sprint retrospective is done, and any other necessary changes are made before 
the next sprint.
Useful when:
    -Continuous improvement is needed

Kanban methodology: Another form of agile methodology. A kanban board is used to 
visualize the tasks and how they progress through different stages. It's perfect 
for giving everyone an immediate visual overview of each piece of work at any given
time and also helps to avoid the bottlenecks of tasks in different stages.
Useful when:
    -A visual representation of the project's progress is needed
    -Good to encourage Work In Progress Limits so your team can stay focused.

Scrumban methodology: A mix of Scrum and Kanban. It combines the structured approach
of Scrum with the visual management of Kanban, using work-in-progress limits during sprints.
Useful when:
    -A balance between structure and flexibility is needed, and visualizing work 
    progress is crucial.

eXtreme programming methodology: Focuses on iterative development, frequent releases,
and collaboration. Practices include pair programming, test-driven development, 
and continuous integration.
Useful when:
    -Fast adaptation and high-quality output are priorities.

Adaptive project framework (APF) methodology: Embraces change and emphasizes flexibility,
iterative planning, and continuous feedback.
Useful when:
    -Projects with evolving requirements and a need for adaptability.

Lean methodology: Maximizes value while minimizing waste. It emphasizes continuous improvement,
eliminating bottlenecks, and delivering value quickly.
Useful when:
    -For streamlining processes and optimizing resource utilization to deliver high-quality
     products efficiently.

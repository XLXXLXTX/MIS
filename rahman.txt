What is a Robot?
A robot is a programmable machine capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. It can be designed to perform 
tasks autonomously or under the control of an operator. Here are some key components and characteristics of robots:

Sensors: Robots are equipped with various sensors to perceive their environment. These sensors can include cameras, infrared 
sensors, ultrasonic sensors, etc.

Actuators: Actuators are mechanisms that enable robots to manipulate objects or move within their environment. Common actuators 
include motors, pneumatic cylinders, and hydraulic systems.

Control System: The control system of a robot consists of software and hardware that process sensor data and determine the 
appropriate actions to take.

Programming: Robots are programmed to perform specific tasks. Programming languages commonly used for robotics include C/C++, 
Python, and ROS (Robot Operating System).

End Effectors: These are tools or attachments at the end of a robot's arm that enable it to interact with its environment. 
Examples include grippers, welding torches, and vacuum pumps.

Mobility: Some robots are stationary, while others are mobile and capable of navigating their environment. Mobile robots may use 
wheels, tracks, or legs for movement.

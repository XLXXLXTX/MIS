Waterfall Model: This is a linear and sequential approach to project management, where each phase of the project (planning, 
design, implementation, testing, deployment) is completed before moving on to the next. It's best suited for projects 
with well-defined requirements and little expected change.

Agile Methodology: Agile is an iterative and flexible approach to project management, where the project is divided into 
small increments or iterations. It emphasizes collaboration, adaptability to change, and delivering working software or 
products frequently. Scrum and Kanban are popular frameworks within the Agile methodology.

Scrum: Scrum is an Agile framework that focuses on delivering value iteratively. It involves organizing work into fixed-length 
iterations called sprints, with regular meetings (such as daily stand-ups, sprint planning, sprint review, and retrospective) 
to keep the team aligned and adapt to changing requirements.

Kanban: Kanban is another Agile framework that visualizes the workflow on a Kanban board. Tasks are represented as cards that 
move through different stages of the workflow (e.g., to-do, in progress, done). It emphasizes limiting work in progress (WIP) 
to improve flow and efficiency.

Lean Methodology: Lean is a project management approach derived from manufacturing principles. It focuses on maximizing value 
while minimizing waste. Lean principles include identifying value, mapping the value stream, creating flow, establishing pull, 
and continuously improving.

PRINCE2: PRINCE2 (Projects IN Controlled Environments) is a process-based project management methodology that provides a 
structured framework for managing projects. It defines roles and responsibilities, divides the project into manageable stages, 
and emphasizes flexibility and scalability.

Critical Path Method (CPM): CPM is a project management technique used for planning and scheduling projects with complex and 
interdependent activities. It identifies the critical path, which is the sequence of tasks that determines the minimum duration 
of the project.

PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique): PERT is similar to CPM but incorporates uncertainty into the project schedule by 
using three time estimates (optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely) to calculate expected durations. It's particularly useful 
for projects with high uncertainty or risk.
